I&#8217;ve been pushing get get cobbler implemented as part of our build infrastructure at work, and there have been very small little bits about the web interface that I&#8217;d like to see improved.  After a few conversations with James Cammarata and throwing together a few <a title="Some cobbler web ui mock ups" href="http://nytefyre.net/images/cobbler.htm" target="_blank">mockups</a> I decided to site down start working on the change.

I&#8217;ve thrown up a github repo for the <a title="My github for cobbler" href="https://github.com/gregswift/cobbler" target="_blank">changes</a> so people can follow along.   At some point I&#8217;m going to write up a bit detailing the thoughts behind some of the changes.
