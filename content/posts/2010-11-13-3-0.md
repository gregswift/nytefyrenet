Despite my intentions of actually using this site, I've yet to blog anything. To be honest, it shouldn't surprise anyone, much less me. However, my desire to rework the 2.0 version of the site got the best of me, and I have migrated the blog into being the 3.0 version of the site. \*cue cheers of excitement\* All that really means is I'm to lazy to code the site any more (not that it was ever hard). One unfortunate side effect is that I haven't determined how to make my resume available through here. On the other hand, I think I was the only one using that feature. I guess it became pointless once I made it non-indexable by search engines.

So where does that leave us? Right where we are. The site is, and will continue to basically just be a series of handy book marks for myself. And maybe I'll eventually write something along the lines of my original intentions.
