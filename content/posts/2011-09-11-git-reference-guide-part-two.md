A very useful [writeup about git workflow](http://watzmann.net/blog/2011/09/git-workflow.html "dlutter's git workflow post") from [David Lutterkort](http://watzmann.net/ "dlutter's blog") of the awesome [augeas](http://augeas.net/ "Augeas project home page") project.  If you haven't heard about augeas, you should check it out.  Its an amazing project that provides programmatic access to configuration files.
