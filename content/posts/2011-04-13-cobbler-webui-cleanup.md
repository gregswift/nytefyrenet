I've been pushing get get cobbler implemented as part of our build infrastructure at work, and there have been very small little bits about the web interface that I'd like to see improved.  After a few conversations with James Cammarata and throwing together a few [mockups](http://nytefyre.net/images/cobbler.htm "Some cobbler web ui mock ups") I decided to site down start working on the change.

I've thrown up a github repo for the [changes](https://github.com/gregswift/cobbler "my github for cobbler") so people can follow along.   At some point I'm going to write up a bit detailing the thoughts behind some of the changes.
