I was right, this did turn out to be a much more interesting CES than the year I went.  However, from the posts I&#8217;ve read I fear I was also right in that it was only more interesting because I don&#8217;t stay up on all the latest hype anymore.  Most of the kewl products I heard about appear to have been leaked months ago.  Ahh well, c&#8217;est la vie.

I do have to give Motorola credit, their <a title="Engadget post about Motorola Atrix 4G" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/motorola-atrix-4g-hits-atandts-website-complete-with-specs/" target="_blank">Atrix 4G</a> with <a title="Engaget post about Atrix 4G's dock" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/motorola-atrix-4gs-webtop-application-turns-your-phone-into-a/" target="_blank">laptop dock</a> for at&t&#8217;s network.  I&#8217;m not in the school of thought that accepts HSPA+ as 4G, but otherwise this is the most enticing Android phone I&#8217;ve personally seen on the market.  I haven&#8217;t been a fan of Motorola&#8217; mobile space in a while, and their first series of Android phones for at&t were just.. depressing. Never one to be fully satisfied, I still want a hardware keyboard and MeeGo.

Speaking of Meego, where was it?  From all I can tell there was a <a title="NetworldWorld talks about Intel showing off a WeTab running Meego" href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/70419" target="_self">tablet</a> and a <a title="CNet hands on with MeeGo netbook" href="http://www.cnetanalysis.com/reviews/ces-2011-hands-on-meego-netbook-review/" target="_self">netbook</a> at Intel&#8217;s booth showing it off.  Where was <a title="Nokia's CES announcement" href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/01/05/nokia-at-ces-2011" target="_blank">Nokia</a>? Apparently they turned into a <a title="Nokia gets non-techies to blog from N8s at CES 2011" href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/01/05/not-so-geeky-after-all-covering-ces-2011-from-a-unique-perspective" target="_blank">news media organization</a> rather than show their wares.  They did have Dolby showing off the N8.  NAVTEQ (the navigation company they purchased) and Qt (the graphical development environment for Symbian^3+ and MeeGo) both had booths.  Nokia was also part of the AT&T Developer summit.  But alas.  No new phones&#8230;

But wait?  What&#8217;s this?  Apparently there are some <a title="Rumors about Nokia's 2011 devices" href="http://mynokiablog.com/2011/01/08/rumours-nokia-n9-being-announced-at-mwc-in-6-weeks-time-more-n9x7-gossip" target="_blank">rumors</a> about the fabled N9 device. With fingers crossed they will supposedly be announcing the N9, X7, and the unknown to me E6-00 device.  That&#8217;s 6 weeks away&#8230; and then who knows how long till release.  Hopefully my battered and bruised e71x can last.
