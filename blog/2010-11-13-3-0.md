Despite my intentions of actually using this site, I&#8217;ve yet to blog anything. To be honest, it shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone, much less me. However, my desire to rework the 2.0 version of the site got the best of me, and I have migrated the blog into being the 3.0 version of the site. \*cue cheers of excitement\* All that really means is I&#8217;m to lazy to code the site any more (not that it was ever hard). One unfortunate side effect is that I haven&#8217;t determined how to make my resume available through here. On the other hand, I think I was the only one using that feature. I guess it became pointless once I made it non-indexable by search engines.

So where does that leave us? Right where we are. The site is, and will continue to basically just be a series of handy book marks for myself. And maybe I&#8217;ll eventually write something along the lines of my original intentions.
