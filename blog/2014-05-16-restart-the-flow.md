My good friend and Rackspace recuiter, Jill, has started a [blog](http://theunrecruiter.wordpress.com/ "The Un-Recruiter")! Which is awesome. So we were talking and I pointed out how I&#8217;ve been slacking. I have actually written a blog post this year, and it succeeded in making my time between posts not reach a year. But still, 11 months is weak.

To that end we&#8217;ve both made a schedule. Me to fix my problem, and her to ramp up. Let see how this goes! :)

Update: and fail&#8230;. (its 3 months later without a single post)
