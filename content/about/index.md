I&#8217;m computer geek with a penchant for open source, although my level of direct contributions has never been quite what I&#8217;d like. PET BASIC was my first programming language, 300 baud my first modem, sun system v my first IRC client, and RHL 5.2 was my first distro. In other words I&#8217;m getting a little old.

The point of this blog is to be a bit more of a collection of thoughts, helpful hints, or maybe commentary something kewl.  I&#8217;ll try to leave the details of my harrowing treks down ten inch deep rapids or the details of my last family gathering out of it.  For your safety and well-being as much as my own.

While it is more technically focused, this is my personal blog. The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my past, present or any future employer.
